        # Setup Preconditions and Expectations Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        # setting interesting memory addresses or labels to certain values,
        # setting up a subroutine or trap call, expecting a specific subroutine
        # call, or giving the lc-3 some console input to use for execution.
        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        # Setup state prior to subroutine call. Here we will simply pass the
        # address of where our data is into the subroutine, as subroutine calls
        # Will only accept integral values.

        self.fillArray(0x8000, array)

        # Call a subroutine named ADD_CHARS with the arguments given.
        # This will perform the following:

        # R7 = a Dummy Value (default x8000)
        # R6 = a Dummy Value (default xF000)

        # MEM[R6] = params[0]
        # MEM[R6 + 1] = params[1]
        # ...
        # MEM[R6 + len(params)-1] = params[len(params) - 1]

        # Run Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Run the students code. You can pass in a number of instructions to
        # execute. With no params though it will run until it halts (via a halt
        # statement, an error occurs explained below, or until
        # DEFAULT_MAX_EXECUTIONS instructions have executed).

        # Assert Postconditions Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Lastly we check the state of the lc-3 after the code has ran and
        # finished. The first thing that you want to do is check if the lc-3
        # has halted cleanly and no warning messages were produced. You then
        # check all of the postconditions.
        #
        # Again it is important that the underlying lc-3 state be used for
        # assertions, and only use the assertions provided by the
        # lc3_unit_test_case class as those methods will produce the replay
        # string when an assertion fails.

        # Note that we used assertReturned over assertHalted. assertReturned has
        # some extra checks to make sure that the subroutine called was returned
        # from correctly.
        #
        # Note that this is a hard assertion by default. Failing this will cause
        # All other soft assertions following it to also fail by default.
        # To reference this assertion in the JSON it is test_name/returned
        self.assertReturned()
        # This checks if the code produced no runtime warning messages.
        # Some common warnings are if the code accesses or writes to memory in
        # privileged regions of memory.
        self.assertNoWarnings()

        # This assert checks if the value at MEM[R6] (which is the return value)
        # is the correct answer.
        # To reference this assertion in the JSON it is test_name/return value
        self.assertReturnValue(length)
        # This assert checks if any registers are clobbered (value changed as a
        # side effect of subroutine). At the very least R5 and R7 should not be
        # clobbered, but others may decide to check all registers.
        # To reference this assertion in the JSON it is
        # test_name/registers unchanged
        #
        # Note by default all registers aside from R6 are checked.
        self.assertRegistersUnchanged([5, 7])
        # This assert checks if:
        # 1) R6 ended up being decremented by 1 by the end of the subroutine
        # 2) R5 (old frame pointer) was stored on the stack and not clobbered.
        # 3) R7 (return address) was stored on the stack and not clobbered.
        # 
        # You pass in the expected stack value upon returning.
        # And the values that was in R5 and R7 upon calling callSubroutine.
        #
        # The three checks above can be referened in the JSON file as follows:
        # 1) test_name/stack
        # 2) test_name/old frame pointer
        # 3) test_name/return address

        # The last assert checks if the appropriate subroutine calls were made.
        # In pylc3 subroutine call verification is only done with the top level
        # function calls and not all of them. See the subroutine call test for
        # a reasoning on why we do testing this way.
        
        # assertSubroutineCallsMade() works on previous calls to
        # expectSubroutineCall() since we didn't make a call to that function it
        # will simply check if no subroutine calls were made.
