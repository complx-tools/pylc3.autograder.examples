        # setting interesting memory addresses or labels to certain values,
        # setting up a subroutine or trap call, expecting a specific subroutine
        # call, or giving the lc-3 some console input to use for execution.
        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        # Call a subroutine named DOUBLE with the arguments given.
        # This will perform the following:

        # recursive subroutine verification as if this is left off the grader
        # would accept an iterative solution without any subroutine calls.
        #
        # The subroutine call checker is very strict and will fail if the code
        # calls subroutines that are not expected. You can mark subroutine calls
        # as optional to whitelist them.
        #
        # Only subroutine calls made by the initial subroutine call should be
        # listed here. The call checker works using inductive reasoning.

        # so on.

        # Run the students code. You can pass in a number of instructions to
        # execute. With no params though it will run until it halts (via a halt

        # Assert Postconditions Step

        # finished. The first thing that you want to do is check if the lc-3
        # has halted cleanly and no warning messages were produced. You then
        # check all of the postconditions.
        #
        # Again it is important that the underlying lc-3 state be used for
        # assertions, and only use the assertions provided by the
        # lc3_unit_test_case class as those methods will produce the replay
        # string when an assertion fails.

        # Note that we used assertReturned over assertHalted. assertReturned has
        # some extra checks to make sure that the subroutine called was returned
        # from correctly.
        self.assertReturned()

        # is the correct answer.

        # This assert checks if any registers are clobbered (value changed as a
        # side effect of subroutine). At the very least R5 and R7 should not be
        # clobbered, but others may decide to check all registers.
        self.assertRegistersUnchanged([5, 7])
        # This assert checks if R6 ended up being decremented by 1 by the end of
        # the subroutine, it needs the expected stack value along with the
        # dummy values in R5 (old frame pointer) and R7 (return address).

        # The last assert checks if the appropriate subroutine calls were made.
        # In pylc3 subroutine call verification is only done with the top level
        # function calls and not all of them, we do this by inductive reasoning.
