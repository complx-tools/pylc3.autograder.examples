    ; In assembly templates we give to students we don't give the code to set up
    ; the stack as the GUI simulator can do that via
    ; Debug > Simulate Subroutine Call.
    ;
    ; The reasoning for this is if students get that part wrong, then the whole
    ; subroutine will fail to work when tested in pylc3.

    ; Subroutine begins here. pylc3 will start executing the subroutine
    ; beginning here by satisfying the preconditions of the lc3 calling
    ; convention and then setting the PC to go here. Within pylc3 a dummy value
    ; is set in R7, and a breakpoint is set at the address given in R7. The code
    ; is ran and we know we returned correctly if the PC hits R7 and the
    ; breakpoint is triggered.
