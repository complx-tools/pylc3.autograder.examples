This demo just showcases a bare minimum test case for pylc3 going over each step
and what is usually done at that step.

A simple program that adds two values present in labels and writes the result to
another label.

The test goes over the basics along with the method to write parameters to label
(similar to how .fill works) along with how to test if a single value at a label
is a specified value.
