        # Assert Postconditions Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        # finished. The first thing that you want to do is check if the lc-3
        # has halted cleanly and no warning messages were produced. You then
        # check all of the postconditions.
        #
        # Again it is important that the underlying lc-3 state be used for
        # assertions, and only use the assertions provided by the
        # lc3_unit_test_case class as those methods will produce the replay
        # string when an assertion fails.

        # This first assertion checks if the code HALTed cleanly.
        # The underlying C++ library (liblc3) has a mode where if the simulator
        # executes an invalid instruction the simulator will end the program.
        # This checks if the lc-3 was halted via a HALT instruction.
        
        # A note on fatal vs hard vs soft assertions, by default failing this
        # assertion will be treated as a hard assertion fail. Hard assertions when
        # they fail will make all subsequent assertions not be checked (but still
        # are logged to the json test report). The only other default hard
        # assertion is assertReturned. Fatal assertions on the other hand will
        # act as a normal assertion does in a unittest framework. The test
        # immediately ends if it fails, the only fatal assertion is loadAsmFile
        # since if that fails no other functions will work correctly.
        self.assertHalted()

        # Some common warnings are if the code accesses or writes to memory in
        # privileged regions of memory.

        # Now check the the linked list nodes

            # way, however a namedtuple is required for the data parameter. This is
            # for a nicer output when the test fails.

            # This will check:
            #   MEM[next_addr] == n
            #   MEM[next_addr + 1] == data

            # This assertion creates two checks in the JSON file
            #   1) nodeAtNext: x<next_addr>
            #   2) nodeAtData: x<next_addr + 1>
