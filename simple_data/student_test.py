        # interrupts, and other things.
        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        # 1) Fill with a specified value.
        # 2) Choose a single random value and fill memory with it.
        # 3) Give every memory address a random value.

        # setting interesting memory addresses or labels to certain values,
        # setting up a subroutine or trap call, expecting a specific subroutine
        # call, or giving the lc-3 some console input to use for execution.

        # set to x4000. as long as the address itself isn't labelled pylc3 won't
        # complain.

        # randomized since it contains the answer.

        # Run Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Run the students code. You can pass in a number of instructions to
        # execute. With no params though it will run until it halts (via a halt
        # statement, an error occurs explained below, or until
        # DEFAULT_MAX_EXECUTIONS instructions have executed).
        self.runCode()

        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Assert Postconditions Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Lastly we check the state of the lc-3 after the code has ran and
        # finished. The first thing that you want to do is check if the lc-3
        # has halted cleanly and no warning messages were produced. You then
        # check all of the postconditions.
        #
        # Again it is important that the underlying lc-3 state be used for
        # assertions, and only use the assertions provided by the
        # lc3_unit_test_case class as those methods will produce the replay
        # string when an assertion fails.

        # This first assertion checks if the code HALTed cleanly.
        # The underlying C++ library (liblc3) has a mode where if the simulator
        # executes an invalid instruction the simulator will end the program.
        # This checks if the lc-3 was halted via a HALT instruction.
        
        # A note on fatal vs hard vs soft assertions, by default failing this
        # assertion will be treated as a hard assertion fail. Hard assertions when
        # they fail will make all subsequent assertions not be checked (but still
        # are logged to the json test report). The only other default hard
        # assertion is assertReturned. Fatal assertions on the other hand will
        # act as a normal assertion does in a unittest framework. The test
        # immediately ends if it fails, the only fatal assertion is loadAsmFile
        # since if that fails no other functions will work correctly.
        self.assertHalted()

        # This checks if the code produced no runtime warning messages.
        # Some common warnings are if the code accesses or writes to memory in
        # privileged regions of memory.

        # We printed out the student's name so check that here.

        # using assertDataAt as it is required for nicer output and telling the
        # student exactly what area of our data was incorrect.
        #
        # To reference this in the json file it will be named
        # Student/dataAt: x4000
