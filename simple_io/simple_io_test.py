        # interrupts, and other things.

        # Three options for initialization based on MemoryFillStrategy
        # 1) Fill with a specified value.
        # 2) Choose a single random value and fill memory with it.
        # 3) Give every memory address a random value.

        # Setup Preconditions and Expectations Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # At this step we setup the initial state for the test. This means
        # setting interesting memory addresses or labels to certain values,
        # setting up a subroutine or trap call, expecting a specific subroutine
        # call, or giving the lc-3 some console input to use for execution.
        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        # terminator is appended to the string.

        # Run Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Run the students code. You can pass in a number of instructions to
        # execute. With no params though it will run until it halts (via a halt
        # statement, an error occurs explained below, or until
        # DEFAULT_MAX_EXECUTIONS instructions have executed).

        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Assert Postconditions Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Lastly we check the state of the lc-3 after the code has ran and
        # finished. The first thing that you want to do is check if the lc-3
        # has halted cleanly and no warning messages were produced. You then
        # check all of the postconditions.
        #
        # Again it is important that the underlying lc-3 state be used for
        # assertions, and only use the assertions provided by the
        # lc3_unit_test_case class as those methods will produce the replay
        # string when an assertion fails.

        # This first assertion checks if the code HALTed cleanly.
        # The underlying C++ library (liblc3) has a mode where if the simulator
        # executes an invalid instruction the simulator will end the program.
        # This checks if the lc-3 was halted via a HALT instruction.
        self.assertHalted()
        # This checks if the code produced no runtime warning messages.
        # Some common warnings are if the code accesses or writes to memory in
        # privileged regions of memory.
        self.assertNoWarnings()
        # This checks if the console output produced matches exactly. Note that
        # unlike simple_string_test.py the output should not end with a nul
        # terminator character.
        #
        # And don't worry no console output is echo'd to the screen when ran.
        # pylc3 will automatically consume console output and store it.
