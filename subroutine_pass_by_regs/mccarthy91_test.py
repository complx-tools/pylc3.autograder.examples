        # 3) Give every memory address a random value.

        # Setup Preconditions and Expectations Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # At this step we setup the initial state for the test. This means
        # setting interesting memory addresses or labels to certain values,
        # setting up a subroutine or trap call, expecting a specific subroutine
        # call, or giving the lc-3 some console input to use for execution.
        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        # Call a subroutine named DOUBLE with the arguments given in registers.
        # This will perform the following:
        # PC = MCCARTHY91
        # R0 = n
        # R7 = a Dummy Value (default x8000)
        # R6 = a Dummy Value (default xF000)
        # A breakpoint is placed at whatever address R7 is pointing to.
        self.callSubroutine('MCCARTHY91', params={0: n})
        
        # Expect subroutine calls to be made. This is important especially for
        # recursive subroutine verification as if this is left off the grader
        # would accept an iterative solution without any subroutine calls.
        #
        # The subroutine call checker is very strict and will fail if the code
        # calls subroutines that are not expected. You can mark subroutine calls
        # as optional to whitelist them.
        #
        # Only subroutine calls made by the initial subroutine call should be
        # listed here. The call checker works using inductive reasoning.
        # You check the base case, then a case that causes 1 recursive call and
        # so on.
        if n < 100:
            # If we aren't the base case then we will call once with n + 11
            # and then 91 if the base case of the recursive call wasn't made.

        # Run Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Run the students code. You can pass in a number of instructions to
        # execute. With no params though it will run until it halts (via a halt
        # statement, an error occurs explained below, or until
        # DEFAULT_MAX_EXECUTIONS instructions have executed).

        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Assert Postconditions Step
        #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Lastly we check the state of the lc-3 after the code has ran and
        # finished. The first thing that you want to do is check if the lc-3
        # has halted cleanly and no warning messages were produced. You then
        # check all of the postconditions.
        #
        # Again it is important that the underlying lc-3 state be used for
        # assertions, and only use the assertions provided by the
        # lc3_unit_test_case class as those methods will produce the replay
        # string when an assertion fails.

        # Note that we used assertReturned over assertHalted. assertReturned has
        # some extra checks to make sure that the subroutine called was returned
        # from correctly.
        self.assertReturned()
        # This checks if the code produced no runtime warning messages.
        # Some common warnings are if the code accesses or writes to memory in
        # privileged regions of memory.
        self.assertNoWarnings()

        # *NOTICE* Unlike the lc3_calling_convention_recursive example we don't use
        # assertReturnValue, that function is exclusively for verifying a
        # subroutine that uses the lc3 calling convention method of subroutine
        # calls.

        # Instead we use assertRegister since the return value will be in a register.
        self.assertRegister(1, n - 10 if n > 100 else 91)

        # This assert checks if any registers are clobbered (value changed as a
        # side effect of subroutine). We'd expect all other registers other than
        # the register being used as a return value to not change.
        self.assertRegistersUnchanged([0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

        # The last assert checks if the appropriate subroutine calls were made.
        # In pylc3 subroutine call verification is only done with the top level
        # function calls and not all of them, we do this by inductive reasoning.

        # expectSubroutineCall()
