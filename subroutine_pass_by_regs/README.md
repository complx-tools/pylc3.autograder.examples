subroutine_pass_by_regs
===

This demo just showcases how to check a subroutine that uses pass by register
and returns via register.

This demo demonstrates a subroutine that is recursive with a single argument,
the famous McCarthy91 function which always returns 91. This demo will show how
to expect a particular subroutine call that must be made to ensure the high
level code is followed.
